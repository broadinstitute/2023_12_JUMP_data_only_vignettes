# A common question we aim to ask is "What other perturbations look like mine?" The easiest way to get the answer for this question is using our [browsable datasets](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main/libs/jump_rr#quick-data-access). In this case we would like to use the 'Matches' databases, which provide cosines similarities between perturbations within a dataset, obtained from all-vs-all calculations.

# The limitation of this approach is that the size of JUMP results in two challenges:
# - Calculating the distances across all pairs of perturbations is intractable for most computers without a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit).
# - The  resultant similarity matrix is too big for web browser-based exploration, so we limit the browsable similarity dataset to tthe op 100 most correlated/anticorrelated pairs of perturbations.

# Despite the aforementioned problems, we provide the full matrix of perturbation distances in case it is of use to data analysts. You can find this and other datasets on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13259495/latest). The data files of interest for this exercise are "{org,crispr}_cosinesim_full.parquet".

# The following analysis focuses on showcasing how to query one of these distance matrices to find all the distances between any given perturbation and all others. One use-case of this is testing how similar perturbation A and B are relative to perturbation C's similarity to A.

# We select the CRISPR dataset for this example. As with previous examples, this is a lazy-loaded data frame. This enables us to download very big datasets without worrying about whether or not they will fill into memory. In these datasets, the values range between 0 and 2, where 0 means that two profiles are the same, 1 means that they are orthogonal (completely uncorrelated) and 2 means that they are completely anticorrelated.

# Note that the only metadata information in this matrix are the column names as JUMP IDs (JCP2022_X), meaning that we will need to use a mapper from these JUMP ids to conventional names; feel free to look at the previous how-to that demonstrates that. We will now select three features at random and look at their correlation matrix

# Whilst in this case it is not a terribly interesting result, this shows that we see no correlation between three randomly selected perturbation.
