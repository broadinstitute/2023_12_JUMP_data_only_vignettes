# Dataset Overview

## Dataset Collection

This collection comprises 4 datasets:

- Principal dataset (`cpg0016`): 116k chemical and \~22k gene perturbations, split across 12 data-generating centers using human U2OS osteosarcoma cells  
- 3 pilot datasets testing:  
  - Different perturbation conditions (`cpg0000-jump-pilot`, including different cell types)  
  - Staining conditions (`cpg0001-cellpainting-protocol`)  
  - Microscopes (`cpg0002-jump-scope`)

## Design of the Dataset

### Cell Line Selection

- We chose U2OS (osteosarcoma) cells for our major data production work because phenotypes are equally or more visible than the few other lines weâ€™ve tested and there is existing data in this cell type (namely, cpg0012-wawer-bioactivecompoundprofiling)

### Perturbation Types in cpg0016

- **Genetic Perturbations:**  
  - CRISPR knockdowns of 7,977 genes (pooled guides targeting each gene are arrayed into plates)  
  - ORF (overexpression) reagents for 15,131 unique genes, with some overlap with CRISPR targets  
- **Chemical Perturbations:**  
  - Partners exchanged \~115,795 compounds  
  - \~5 replicates of each compound  
  - Performed as 1-2 replicates at 3-5 different sites globally  
    

  Do note that these numbers were based on JUMP Cell Painting IDs and there may be some minor duplication of genes.

### Control Sets of genes and compounds

- **JUMP-Target:**  
    
  - 306 compounds and 160 corresponding genetic perturbations  
  - Designed to assess connectivity (gene-compound matching, based on annotated gene targets of each compound) in profiling assays  
  - Includes 384-well plate maps  
  - [Documentation](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/JUMP-Target)


- **JUMP-MOA:**  
    
  - 90 compounds in quadruplicate, laid out on a 384-well plate  
  - Represents 47 mechanism-of-action classes  
  - Designed for assessing connectivity between genes and compounds  
  - [Documentation](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/JUMP-MOA)


- **Positive Controls:**  
    
  - Set of 8 compounds per sample plate

### Cell Painting Protocol

The experiments used an optimized Cell Painting protocol, published in [Cimini et al. Nature Protocols 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37344608/), which builds upon the original [Bray et al. Nature Protocols 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27560178/). For detailed implementation guidance, see the [Cell Painting wiki](https://broad.io/cellpaintingwiki).

## Available Components

From 12 sources (data-generating centers):

- Raw microscopy images  
- CellProfiler analysis output  
- Single-cell profiles  
- Well-aggregated profiles (all single cells in a given sample well)  
- Metadata files

### Data Processing Levels

1. **Images**  
     
   - 5 channels (DNA, RNA, ER, AGP, Mito) per imaging site within a well  
   - Multiple sites (images) per well

   

2. **CellProfiler Output**  
     
   - Cell segmentation images  
   - Image-level quality metrics

   

3. **Profile Data**  
     
   - Single-cell level profiles  
   - Well-aggregated profiles  
   - Normalized features  
   - Well-aggregated profiles after feature selection applied

   

4. **Assembled Subsets**  
     
   - Combined datasets in parquet format  
   - URLs available in [profile index](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets/blob/main/manifests/profile_index.csv)

## Data Access

### AWS Storage

Hosted in the Cell Painting Gallery ([registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/](https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/)). Access and download is free through AWS Open Data Program.

### Zenodo data

Many of the processed datasets and manifest files can be found associated with the Broad Institute Imaging Platform [community](https://zenodo.org/communities/broad-imaging/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest).

### Programmatic Access

- [How-to guides](../howto/0_howto.md) provided  
- APIs and libraries for programmatic access:  
  - [cpgdata](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cpg/tree/main/cpgdata):   
  - [jump-portrait](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main/libs/jump_portrait): Fetch images using standard gene/compound names into a Python session or filesystem.  
  - [jump-babel](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main/libs/jump_babel): Translate perturbation names and access very basic metadata.

## Latest Updates

### Current Status (2024/12)

- All pilot dataset components available  
- Principal dataset: most components available from 12 sources  
- Key metadata files accessible  
- Assembled profile subsets ready for analysis

### Coming Soon

- Extension of metadata and notebooks to pilots ([issue](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets-private/issues/93))  
- Curated compound annotations from ChEMBL ([issue](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets-private/issues/78))  
- Deep learning embeddings using pre-trained networks ([issue](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets-private/issues/50))

### Quality Notes

- Cross-modality matching still being improved (the three modalities are ORF, CRISPR, and chemicals)  
- Some wells/plates/sources excluded for quality control  
- Within-modality matching generally reliable
