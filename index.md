# JUMP Cell Painting Hub

JUMP (Joint Undertaking for Morphological Profiling) Cell Painting is an effort to produce data and resources to make use of [Cell Painting](https://jump-cellpainting.broadinstitute.org/cell-painting) data. It is the result of years of work by the JUMP-CP [Consortium](https://jump-cellpainting.broadinstitute.org/partners).

## Getting Started with JUMP

What is the purpose of this website? To provide up-to-date info on everything JUMP-related. We aim to minimize friction for developers, technical writers and biologists to produce and access novel insights and tools. We aim to make this the one-stop shop for the vast majority of JUMP questions, be it computational or biological.

## Choose Your Own Path

1. Just exploring the data?
   
   - Use a web interface; no programming required:
     * [JUMPer tools](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main/libs/jump_rr#quick-data-access) by Carpenter–Singh Lab (Muñoz et al.) 
     * [Morpheus](https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/) by Broad Institute
     * [JUMP-CP Data Explorer](https://phenaid.ardigen.com/jumpcpexplorer/) by Ardigen, 
     * [JUMP-CP Data Portal](https://www.springscience.com/jump-cp) by Spring Discovery, 

   You can look up images for a sample, distinguishing features, most-similar genes or compounds, and more\!

 

2. Want to fetch and analyze data?
   
   - Follow our [how-to guides](./howto/0_howto.md) for common analyses

 

3. Looking to build tools?
   
   - Use our Python libraries [cpgdata](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cpg/tree/main/cpgdata), [jump-portrait](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main/libs/jump_portrait), [jump-babel](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main/libs/jump_babel) and other libraries in the [monorepo](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main)
   - Access the [metadata schema](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets/tree/main/metadata)
