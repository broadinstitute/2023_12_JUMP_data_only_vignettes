# JUMP hub

Focal point for JUMP information and data analysis pipelines.

Additionally, this repository can be used as a way to install essential dependencies for an exploratory analysis of JUMP morphological data.

Python notebooks are in the `colab` branch. Notebooks are autogenerated using [these](https://github.com/broadinstitute/2023_12_JUMP_data_only_vignettes/tree/main/tools) scripts.
